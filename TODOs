TODO:
Consider refactoring the vignettes (lapply's for example) so that there are
central functions that we can just call.

Definitely think about if there is a nicer way to handle Table 7's code inside
of a function.

Fix the parallelisation, since I did not do that very well the first time. This
might use https://stackoverflow.com/a/15638393 as a general idea, since mine did
not work.

Write some proper tests of what we are intending?
  Problem with this one is that I am not a dev team and I have already spent a
  lot of time on this code base. Maybe for the next project?
